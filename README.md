## Step 3: Using Proxies with yt-dlp

Specify a proxy directly in the command using the --proxy option:

```
yt-dlp --proxy "http://username:password@proxy_address:port" <video_url>
```

If no authentication is required:

```
yt-dlp --proxy "http://proxy_address:port" <video_url>
```

Example Command with Proxy:

```
yt-dlp --proxy "http://123.45.67.89:8080" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

```
yt-dlp --proxy "http://123.45.67.89:8080" -F https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```
If the command lists available formats, the proxy is working. If it fails, double-check the proxy details.
